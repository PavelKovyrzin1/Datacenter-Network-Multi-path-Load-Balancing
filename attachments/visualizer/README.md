# Visualizer

The following attachments are provided and documented:
* `visualizer.html`: a for-fun web page for participants to visualize their simulation process;
* `sample-log.json`: a sample file generated by the judging environment, to be directly used with the visualizer given above;

### Usage
1. Open `visualizer.html` in your browser.
2. Drag `sample-log.json`, or any json file of the same format (maybe downloaded from the platform) into the "drop log here" area.
3. If the json is valid, a fat tree is rendered; otherwise check browser console for error information.
4. Check `animate` box to visualize the network data flow automatically; uncheck to pause.
5. Hover the mouse on a specific node will show the nodes that are directly connected to selected node, and the raw metrics of current node.
6. If jumping to a specific timestamp, type in the valid timestamp number to the input box next to "goto timestamp" and press enter.
